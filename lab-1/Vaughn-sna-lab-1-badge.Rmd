The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies social network analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a network study that makes use of sociograms to visualize relational data.** You are also welcome to select one of the research papers listed in the [essential readings](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/tree/main/sna-labs/sna-lab-4) that may have piqued your interest.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   Ma, S., Herman, G. L., West, M., Tomkin, J., & Mestre, J. (2019). Studying STEM Faculty Communities of Practice through Social Network Analysis. The Journal of Higher Education, 1--27. <doi:10.1080/00221546.2018.1557100>

2.  Who are the network's actors and how are they represented visually?

    -   120 faculty members engaged in STEM Communities of Practice

3.  What ties connect these actors and how are they represented visually?

    -   Interactions between faculty members, differentiated between "coversation" and "collaboration" ties

4.  Why were these relations of interest to the researcher?

    -   To visualize and understand how discussions and collaborations extend across and within departments and CoPs

5.  Finally, what makes this collection of actors a social network?

    -   They are a specific group of individual within a closed sytem, STEM education, who are interacting together for a variety of reasons

Draft a research question for a population you may be interested in studying, or that would be of interest to educational researchers, and that would require the collection of relational data and answer the following questions:

1.  What relational data would need to be collected?

    -   Research question: What is the current network that exists at NKU to support STEM students? Department or unit of actors, types of interactions: collaborations, committees, referring students, etc. and strength or number of interactions

2.  For what reason would relational data need to be collected in order to address this question?

    -   To visualize the interactions between units, departments, and individuals

3.  Explain the analytical level at which these data would need to be collected and analyzed.

    -   I would need to collect data on actors such as individuals as well as units, and connections, ties, that might include strength of relationship, number of interactions, length of relationship, and so forth.

4.  How does this differ from the ways in which individual or group behavior is typically conceptualized and modeled in conventional educational research?

    -   The data is much less about impact of actions or behaviors and more about looking at the actions/relationships themselves.

### Part II: Data Product

Using one of the data sets provided in your data folder, **your goal for this lab is to create a polished sociogram that visually represents this network.** For example, you may be interested in examining how shared characteristics among school leaders might help explain tie formation, such as gender, level of trust in colleagues, or whether they work at the school or district level.

**Alternatively, you may use your own data set to estimate models akin to those we estimated in the guided practice.** 

I highly recommend creating a new R script in your lab-1 folder to complete this task. When your code is ready to share, use the code chunk below to share the final code for your model and answer the questions that follow.

```{r, my-data-product}

                      size = local_size()))

                 alpha = .2) +

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Intro to SNA Badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review:

1.  Change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):

    -   Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account.

    -   Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [SNA Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis/discussions/1). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
